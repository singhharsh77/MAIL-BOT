## 📋 Problem Statement
Customer Success (CS) and Operations teams often spend hours daily manually drafting follow-up emails. While standard templates exist, they require significant manual editing to include specific context from meetings or support tickets. This manual process leads to:
* **Inconsistent Brand Voice:** Variation in tone across different team members.
* **Response Latency:** Time-consuming drafting delays client communication.
* **Operational Risk:** High probability of human error when manually copying technical details like ticket numbers or URLs.

## 💡 Solution
The **AI Mail Bot** automates the "context-filling" phase of email drafting. By selecting a base template and providing raw input (such as a meeting transcript or internal notes), the tool uses OpenAI to:
1.  **Extract relevant data** (Action items, names, specific technical issues).
2.  **Synthesize context** into the selected professional template.
3.  **Offer a "Human-in-the-Loop" workflow** via a Rich Text Editor for final refinements before sending.

## 🖥️ UI & Output
### 1. Operations Frontend
A split-screen interface designed for maximum efficiency:
* **Left Pane (Input):** Template selection with search, recipient management (To/Cc/Bcc), and context boxes for transcripts or additional instructions.
* **Right Pane (Editor):** A real-time preview and built-in Rich Text Editor (WYSIWYG) suite.

### 2. Intelligent Output
The output is dynamically generated by merging the selected **Email Template** with the **AI Prompt**. The AI ensures that specific details from the transcript—like specific dates or technical problems—are woven naturally into the professional structure of the template.

## 💻 Development & Environment
### Why `code.gs` cannot "run" directly in VS Code
This project runs on the **Google Apps Script (GAS)** V8 engine. 
* **Backend Logic:** The `.gs` files utilize Google-exclusive services (`MailApp`, `HtmlService`, `PropertiesService`) that are not present in standard Node.js or browser environments.
* **Execution:** Code must be pushed to Google’s servers to function.

### Recommended Local Workflow
To develop in VS Code with full version control, use **clasp** (Command Line Apps Script Projects):
1.  **Install Clasp:** `npm install -g @google/clasp`
2.  **Authenticate:** `clasp login`
3.  **Sync:** Use `clasp pull` to get files and `clasp push` to upload local changes to the Google Script engine.
